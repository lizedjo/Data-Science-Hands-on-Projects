# Data-Science-Hands-on-Project

This repository is presenting a predictive analysis of the successful landing likelihood of the Space X Falcon 9 first stage. This capstone project was undertaken as part of my IBM Data Science Specialization course.

## Notebooks

### SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction

- **File:** SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb
- **Description:** Creating a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs. Finding the best method among SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression.

### Jupyter Labs EDA with SQL

- **File:** jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb
